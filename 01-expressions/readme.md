# Expressions and Values

## Values
Values are *data* that are either numbers, text or one of the other data type. 

## Expressions
An expression is a chunk of code that *evaluates* to a value. This is quite common in Maths. For example, suppose we have

```
2 + 3
```

The above expression will *evaluates* to `4`.

The computer evaluates expression from left to right, and can perform one process at a time. So if we have

```
2 + 3 + 4
```

The `2 + 3` will be evaluated to the value `5`, which will result in the intermediate step below (which happens in the background):

```
5 + 4
```

Which will then be evaluated to

```
9
```
